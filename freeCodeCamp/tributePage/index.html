                    <strong>Some of her work</strong><br>
                    <strong>* Work with swine flu</strong>

                    <strong>* Work with Ebola virus</strong>
                    &nbsp; - Dr. Adadevoh correctly diagnosed Liberian Patrick Sawyer as Nigeriaâ€™s first case of Ebola at First Consultant Hospital in Lagos, Nigeria in July 2014. Dr. Adadevoh kept Patrick Sawyer in the hospital despite his insistence that he had a bad case of Malaria. Sawyer wanted to attend a business conference in Calabar, Nigeria. Adadevoh led the team who oversaw the treatment of Patrick Sawyer a Liberian, the first patient diagnosed with Ebola in Nigeria. Dr. Adadevoh also kept Patrick Sawyer at the hospital despite receiving a request from a Liberian ambassador to release him from the hospital. Dr. Adadevoh tried to create an isolation area, despite the lack of protective equipment, by creating a wooden barricade outside Patrick Sawyer's door. Her heroic effort saved the nation from widespread infection. As of these events, Nigerian Doctors were on strike, and that could have caused severe crises. The professionalism and thorough medical examination carried out by Dr. Ameyo Adadevoh was impeccable. Adadevoh also provided staff with relevant information about the virus, procured protective gear and quickly contacted relevant officials. As a result of her report, the Nigerian government declared a national public health emergency and the Nigerian Ministry of Health set up an Ebola Emergency Operations Center. WHO declared Nigeria to be Ebola-free on October 20, 2014.
